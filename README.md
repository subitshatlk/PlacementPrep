# PlacementPrep
An interactive game based job placement preparation mobile app developed using Flutter and Firebase as database

# ABSTRACT :
In the process of recruitment during job placements, students often face multiple difficulties with regard to getting placed in a reputable firm or company. The major stressful issue for any pre final or final year student is 
having a proper schedule which they can rely on to ace the respective interviews, online tests or presentations. They also need to know the list of upcoming offers
from well known and esteemed companies. Other issues include missing out on opportunities due to miscommunication and work pressure. Hence the need for
a well organised application that could ease the level of hardship among students is absolutely inevitable.The main goal of the project is to develop a student friendly mobile
application that can bring the students, alumni as well as the job offer providers on one single platform. This application could help the students to attend the
interviews fearlessly and be well prepared in advance. Also, a clear list of how to prepare for such interviews can be beneficial to the students in building their
knowledge in a specific field of interest.

# MAIN IDEA:
This app focuses on scheduling and notifying the students regarding the company offers and trains them to attempt
the preliminary tests and clear them with a good shot with an interactive game
based manner. All that the student needs to do is register and login , this app
provides all the list of companies along with their requirements . Users can
shortlist any number of companies they want and can set remainder accordingly.
This app motivates the students to take up more quizzes and
academic related games which will build their knowledge in a specific field
which will help them crack interviews. It will also provide a platform for
the students to get familiarised about a specific company and their process of
candidate selection by reading several alumni reviews.
The admin will frequently upload all the incoming offers from
companies, the results and other related information. A list of all the companies
ready to provide internships or placement offers with the corresponding link to
take up the test, along with the requirements of the job will be listed out for
the students to view and eligible students after registering will then be alerted a
few days beforehand for preparation purposes. Students will be provided a list
of topics(checkbox) to be covered which they can check after completing the
particular topic. In this way, they can check how far theyâ€™re on track. This app
also notifies the remaining topics to be covered at a regular interval and along
with that, a quick quiz on the covered topics will also be provided for the student
to take up to test their preparation level. After completing the quiz and topics to
cover, a student can take up the games which are related to their field of interest
and get scores at the end of completing a game.
